# ANN Classifier Hub
Welcome to this repository! **This repository contains various neural network models** for different tasks, including the `Chess Piece Classifier model`, `Vehicle Classifier model` and `Tomato OR Apple Classifier model`.

## Chess Piece Classifier
The Chess Piece Classifier model is **designed to classify images of chess pieces into their respective categories**. It has been trained on a large dataset of labeled chess piece images and utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve accurate classification. The model can be used to identify the type of chess piece present in an image, such as `King`, `Queen`, `Bishop`, `Knight`, `Rook`, or `Pawn`.

## Vehicle Classifier
The Vehicle Classifier model is **designed to classify images of vehicles into different categories**, such as `car`, `truck`, `bike`, `cycle`, `bus`, `helicopter`, `scooty` and `plane`. It has been trained on a diverse dataset of labeled vehicle images. The model can identify the type of vehicle present in an image, making it useful for applications like traffic analysis, object detection, and more.

## Tomato OR Apple Classifier
The Tomato OR Apple Classifier model is **designed to classify `tomatoes` and `apples`**.
